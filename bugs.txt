1. Title: Crash on immediate exit with +synctex
   Severity: Fixed
   Detailed report: If one exits gvim immediately after startup, it induces
                    a crash.
   Reason: Tries to remove .synctex.gz file which may not exit in case on
           compilation happened.

2. Title: Compilation error causes an exception in exception.
   Severity: High
   Detailed report: Exception throws a string-exception concatnation error.
   Reason:

3. Title: All files need not be removed at every compilation
   Severity: Low
   Detailed report: Specially with +synctex it is unnecessary to remove all
                    files at every compilation. We should be able to choose
					what to remove when. This has been partially fixed.
   Reason: It detects rm option Default and doesn't delete if synctex flag
           is set.

4. Title: Occasional 2 gvims with +synctex
   Severity: Low
   Detailed report: Due to delay in starting up the server, sometimes two
                    gvims start up. 
   Reason: This is an operating system based delayed. Maybe a better idea
		   would be to check if the server is up before sending commands to
		   it. Partial fix by setting a two second delay.

5. Title: Multiple -synctex=1 switches 
   Severity: Fixed.
   Detailed report: the latex switches array seems to accumulate -synctex=1
                    switch.
   Reason: Possible we are setting it at each run. Need to find exact
           reason.

6. Title: bibtex=auto causes crash
   Severity: Fixed
   Detailed report: Sometimes fulltex tries to run bibtex even when it is
                    not necessary.
   Reason: the auto-reckoning if bibtex should run gives false
           positives when latex cite command is not issued.
